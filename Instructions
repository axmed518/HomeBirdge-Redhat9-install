Step 1: Install Node.js v18.x

1. Before you begin, ensure that curl is installed on your system. If curl is not installed, you can install it using the following command:
sudo yum install -y curl

2. Download the Node.js setup script:
curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_18.x -o nodesource_setup.sh

3. Run the Node.js setup script as root:
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh

4. Install Node.js:
sudo yum install -y nodejs

5. Verify the installation:
node -v

6. Install additional dependencies
sudo yum install -y gcc-c++ make net-tools python2 python3

7. Install build tools
sudo yum groupinstall -y 'Development Tools'

8. Test node is working
node -v


Step 2: Install Homebridge and Homebridge UI

1. Install Homebridge and the Homebridge UI using the following command:
sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge homebridge-config-ui-x

2. To setup Homebridge as a service that will start on boot you can use the provided hb-service command.
sudo hb-service install --user homebridge

This command will do everything that is required to setup Homebridge and the Homebridge UI as a service on your system, it will create the homebridge user if it does not already exist, and create the default Homebridge config.json under /var/lib/homebridge if it does not already exist.

When setting up Homebridge as a service using this command, the UI will stay online even if Homebridge is crashing due to a bad plugin or configuration error.

You should also add the Homebridge port, available from the Config tab once you login to the Homebridge UI.

Step 3: Login to the Homebridge UI

The Homebridge UI web interface will allow you to install, remove and update plugins, and modify the Homebridge config.json and manage other aspects of your Homebridge service.

Login to the web interface by going to http://<ip address of your server>:8581.

To find the IP address of your server you can run:

hostname -I
